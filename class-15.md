## Readings: What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
***
### Notes:
- > Five years ago, Google — one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity — became focused on building the perfect team. 
- The 1st paragraph talks about a lady named Julia Rozovsky. She seeked a study group for help and instead of any positive outcome/gain, she ended up hating the Teams unprofessional dynamic. It was a major source of stress.
- > Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.
  * > "We’re living through a golden age of understanding personal productivity," says Marshall Van Alstyne
  * We can figure out why some people are more effective than everyone else.
- Interesting enough, some Google's most effective teams were composed of friends who socialized outside work.
  * > One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink.
- researchers from Project Aristole conluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google's teams.
- > 'As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.'
  * This quote really made sense to me. When you only allow selective individuals to speak, you deny others to contribute to a problem which can result into a chain effect of negative emotions that now carry into the workspace.
