# What is debugging?

Debugging is a process for testing, finding the errors and reducing them from happening in future. Debugging JavaScript either requires having support for JavaScript debugger keyword, breakpoint support with web browser tools, or third-party tools. These tools range from browser plugins like Augury which is an Angular development and debugging extension for Chrome, third-party tools & more. It is also possible to use 'debugger' keyword support (depending on the browser type and version) and to freeze the code at a given point and investigate the issue.

Exception Handling
This is one of the key areas, where it is required to effectively handle the errors and show users with sufficient information about the situation and pass that information to the developer. This can also be handled based on Log Levels.
