# All about Objects

Objects group together variables and functions. Once a variable is added to an object it becomes a property, a property basically tells us about the object, think of it as a descriptive term.
Once a function is added to an object it becomes a method. It somewhat keeps its definition, methods represent tasks.

## Keys and Values

Properties and methods have a key and a value. For example ( The hotel example in the book is pretty good, refer to that)

Name: Shania
fav color: green
ETC.

But remember an object cannot have two keys with the same name. So no 

Name: Shania , Shania

## Creating an object

Literal notation is the easiest and most used way, so im only gonna to acknowledge this one..
 var hotel = {
     name: Shania
     fav color: green
 }

The above is an object. (see pg 106) for another semi-easy way
