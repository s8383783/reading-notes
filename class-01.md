# HTML

Html is the skeleton of the webpage. You are able to put your structure into place. It is easier to write your HTML after you create a wireframe. A wireframe is a bare bones mock up of the web page you want to design.
When making your wireframe make sure to keep your audience in mind, as they will be the main consumers of your content.
A website is composed of a head, body. The head is seen by the coder and the body is the content your audience will see.

Below are some common HTML terms

1. opening tag: This is the name of the element wrapped in open and closing brackets. <   p  >
2. closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag but instead looks like this <   /   p   >
3. content: Exactly what it says. This is the content of the element, this usually comes after the opening tag
4. element: an element is all the above combined.

## CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a program that lets you make changes to your webpages. CSS is the decorative part of web design. It contains two components; properties and values.
CSS syntax is pretty easy. THe flow of CSS syntax makes sense and makes it easy to follow.
For example if I want to use inline CSS in a HTML document I would put the style element inside the HTML head.
This is not the best way to write CSS as it can become very tedious and will make you HTML code harder to follow.
The External stylesheet is the best option as it keeps your CSS and HTML separate and easier to read. You will need to tell the HTML doc where the CSS file is located.
Selectors are used to pick out specific parts of HTML to edit. If you use multiple changes to the same selector it will pick the one on the bottom, as CSS reads top to bottom.

JavaScript is a front end programming language. It is the language that is most often used when making webpages. It is seperate from the programming language 'Java'. What is unique about Javascript is that it is both a front end and back end programming language. Java Script mimics other languages making it a great one to learn first. Using Java script you are able to add all the bells and whistles to your webpage. You can add prompts for the user to complete and incorporate pop ups. The if statement when using programming languages is very important as it is used alot. In java script the if statement can make conditionals that rely on boolen logic.

1 + 1 = true so your next block of code would be intiated. If the answer is negative it will move on to the else statement and intiate that block of code..
