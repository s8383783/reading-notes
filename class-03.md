Decisions and Loops

All for statements have what is called a conditional statement. This is the thing that the code is checking for. After you set your variable and the conditional statement is made, the next part of the for loop is what to do if the condition is not met. You can do things like icrement the count or have a alert.
Comparison operators:
'===' strict equals
'!==' does not equal
'<' less than
'>' greater than
'<=' less than or equal to
'>' greater than or equal to

Three types of loops,
For loop
While loop
do while loop

For loops are used when you know how many times you want to go through your iterations
while loops are for when you are not sure.

ALL VALUES EQUATE TO TRUTHY OR FALSY.
For example even a 0 reads as false. Same as null and undefined.
