# React and Forms
What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
a component that is renders the form or element also controls it. 

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
So it can update in multiple components?

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
event.target.value

Why would we use a ternary operator?
shorter code. easier to read.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
 x===y ?
 console.log(true) : console.log(false);
