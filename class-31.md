# Component-Based Architecture
## What is a component? 
A component is one of the core building blacks of React. Everything you build in React will be made of components. Like lil legos.
Components are Reuseable, replaceable, not context specific, can be extended and is independent of other components.  




## What are props? 
Props is short for properties, in React they are used for passing data from one component to another
They flow uni-directionally. Parent to child. will not go the opposite way. 
The data is also read only. The prop data should not be changed by child components. 


## Things I want to know more about 
Can the directional flow in React go anyother way? I can see multiple sceanarios in which having the child compenent edit information would be useful.
